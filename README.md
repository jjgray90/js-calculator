## Brief:

A simple calculator built using javascript functions interacting with the DOM.

- Accept a minimum of 2 inputs, perform an operation and show the output.
- Do not use the eval() method.
- Code must be highly readable.

## Approach & Concepts:

- Use of Javascript event listeners & query selectors for DOM interaction
- REGEX used to identify inputs and operators
- A mixture of if statements, ternary operators and switch cases to compute & display simple calculations
- SASS/BEM naming conventions
- CSS Grid for layout
- Audio used for button clicks & easter egg (07734)
- E2E testing with Cypress
